# Student Management System (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a **menu-driven Java program** designed to efficiently manage student records. It provides functionalities to **add, search, update, and delete students** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in Java. The system is built with **multiple Java classes** to maintain a clean structure.

## ðŸš€ Features & Functions
The system includes the following core functionalities:

1. **Add Student (`addStudent`)** â€“ Allows users to input student details such as PRN, Name, and Marks, storing them in an array of objects.
2. **Display Students (`displayStudents`)** â€“ Lists all students with their respective details in a structured format.
3. **Search Students**
   - **By PRN (`searchStudentByPRN`)** â€“ Finds a student based on their PRN (unique ID).
   - **By Name (`searchStudentByName`)** â€“ Searches for students by name.
   - **By Position (`searchStudentByPosition`)** â€“ Retrieves a student based on their position in the stored list.
4. **Update Student (`updateStudent`)** â€“ Modifies the details of an existing student.
5. **Delete Student (`deleteStudent`)** â€“ Removes a student from the record.

Each function is implemented in `StudentOperations.java`, while `Main.java` handles user interactions through a menu-driven interface.
